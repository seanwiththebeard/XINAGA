# XINAGA
XINAGA is a cross-platform library for graphics/audio/IO on retro platforms (Commodore 64, Apple II...) with an Ultima clone in mind, originating from my C64 RPG project and the experience of adding Apple II as an additional target. The goals are to provide character-based graphics, tilemap engine, input handling, sound playback, and disk file saving/loading. 

The name XINAGA is a backronym for "XINAGA is not a great acronym" - a joke inspired by Microsoft's XNA API. and conveniently sounds like a JRPG ability affecting multiple targets
